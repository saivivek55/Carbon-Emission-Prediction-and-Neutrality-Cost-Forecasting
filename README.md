# üåç Carbon Emission Prediction & Neutrality Cost Forecasting

## üîé Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting carbon emissions and estimating the cost of achieving carbon neutrality for top polluting countries. Leveraging a CRISP-DM methodology, the analysis uses time-series modeling to support sustainable policy decisions and emission management strategies.

### üìä Datasets Used
- **World Data:** Contains global carbon emission indicators collected from the World Bank, covering 245 countries and 80+ environmental features.
- **USA Data:** Includes national-level carbon emission metrics sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), provided as multiple time-series records.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling Approach
We explored and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
- **Hybrid CNN-IBFA**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

Based on model performance, the **LSTM model**- achieving an MSE of 0.0038 and R¬≤ of 0.8892, was selected for final forecasting due to its effectiveness in capturing long-term temporal dependencies in emission trends.

### üß™ Evaluation Metrics
Each model was assessed using:
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)  
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **R¬≤** (R-squared)

The LSTM model achieved the best overall results, making it ideal for predicting both emissions and neutrality cost scenarios.

## üìà Key Features
- Time-series forecasting of carbon emissions using LSTM  
- Emission trend analysis across key global and national datasets  
- Carbon neutrality cost prediction for top polluting countries
